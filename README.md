# Extension Name: Layout Grid Visualizer

## Overview
The Layout Grid Visualizer is a Chrome extension designed to help web developers and designers visualize the underlying grid system of a website layout. This tool allows users to overlay a customizable grid on any webpage, making it easier to understand the structure and alignment of elements based on a defined grid system, such as the 12-column layout commonly used in frameworks like Bootstrap.

## Key Features

1. **Customizable Grid Settings:**
   - Define the total width of the grid (e.g., 1320px), number of columns (e.g., 12), and gutter size (e.g., 32px).
   - All fields are validated: grid width, columns, and gutter size must be positive and logical.
   - Invalid values are auto-corrected, highlighted, and explained with tooltips.

2. **Dynamic Grid Overlay:**
   - Overlay a grid on the current webpage, displaying the defined columns and gutters.
   - Toggle the grid on and off with a button (per tab).
   - Move the grid overlay by dragging it with the mouse.
   - Center the grid overlay at any time with a dedicated button.

3. **Overlay Customization:**
   - Instantly customize the grid overlay's color and opacity for visibility against any background.

4. **User-Friendly & Accessible Interface:**
   - Simple popup interface to adjust grid settings, toggle the overlay, center the grid, and reset to defaults.
   - All controls are accessible with aria-labels and keyboard navigation.
   - The "Toggle Grid" button is disabled if any field is invalid.
   - All changes update the grid instantly for immediate feedback.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Design Understanding:** Visualize the layout structure, making it easier to create and maintain consistent designs.
- **Debugging Tool:** Identify layout issues, such as misalignments or spacing problems, for quicker fixes.
- **Learning Resource:** Serves as a learning tool for those new to grid systems, providing a visual representation of how grids work in web design.

## Development Considerations
- **Chrome Extensions API:** Utilizes content scripts to inject the grid overlay into the webpage and manipulate the DOM for visualization.
- **Performance Optimization:** The extension is designed to run efficiently without causing lag or slowdowns on the webpage.
- **Accessibility:** The UI is designed for accessibility, with proper labels and instant feedback for all users.
